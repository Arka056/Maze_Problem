# Maze Problem Solution

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for the Maze Problem, where the goal is to find a path from the start to the destination in a given maze. The implementation includes various pathfinding algorithms and can handle different maze configurations.


## Features

• Solves maze problems using BFS, DFS, and other pathfinding algorithms.

• Supports different maze sizes and configurations.

• Provides a visualization of the solution path.

• Handles obstacles and dead ends efficiently.

## Algorithms Used

• Breadth-First Search (BFS): Finds the shortest path.

• Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores all possible paths.
